overview

1. binary array (using partition of quicksort, preferrably hoare here)
2. array with 3 values (partition, dutch national flag)
3. array of size n and small ranged values (counting sort)
4. array of size n and rage id of quadratic or cubic (radix sort)
5. array is uniformly distributes across a ramge (bucket sort)
6. when memory writes are costly (selection sort, cycle sort optimally)
7. when adjacent alements swap are allowed (bubble sort, cocktail sort (optimized bubble))
8. when array is small (insertion sort is best, 10-20)
9. when available extra memory is small (shell sort)

general purpose sorting algorithms
merge sort O(n log n) D & C
heap sort O (n log n)
quick sort O (n log n), quad in worst D & C

quick sort is fastest, merge sort is the only stable, works best for linked list
